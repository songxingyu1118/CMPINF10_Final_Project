## Abstract
---

After completing our research and data analysis, we concluded that New Homestead is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. We found this by combining our metric research into crime rates, pre-1950 housing, and traffic density. This conclusion is somewhat suprising as it is not as frequently talked about as other neighborhoods such as Squirrel Hill, which was number 5 on our rankings, but after searching up New Homestead we found that the neighborhood is actually a small, safe, and vibrant rural community with new housing being built. These reviews all align with all of our metrics. We confirmed this thorugh additional research and found that it has low crime rates and "it is one of the best places to live in Pennsylvania" according to Niche.
